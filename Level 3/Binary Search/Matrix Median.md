# Matrix Median

Given a N cross M matrix in which each row is sorted, find the overall median of the matrix. Assume N\*M is odd.

For example,

```
Matrix=
[1, 3, 5]
[2, 6, 9]
[3, 6, 9]

A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 9]

Median is 5. So, we return 5.
```

**Note:** No extra memory is allowed.

## Hint

We cannot use extra memory, so we canâ€™t actually store all elements in an array and sort the array.
But since, rows are sorted it must be of some use, right?

Note that in a row you can binary search to find how many elements are smaller than a value X in O(log M).

```python
 place = 0
for i in range(r):
    place += bisect_right(A[i], mid)
```

## Solution Approach

Well Consider the following matrix and sort A.

```
Matrix=
[1, 3, 5]
[2, 6, 9]
[3, 6, 9]

A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 9]
```

We will be maintaining

`low = lowest in matrix`

`high = highest in matrix`

`mid = (low + high)//2`

median will always at (r\*c+1)//2

Find the place where this mid should be placed.

```python
if place < req:
    low = mid + 1
else:
    high = mid
```

continue this till `low < mid`

## Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def findMedian(self, A):
        r = len(A)
        c = len(A[0])
        low = float('inf')
        high = -float('inf')
        for i in range(r):
            low = min(A[i][0], low)
            high = max(A[i][c-1], high)
        req = (r*c + 1) // 2
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            place = 0
            for i in range(r):
                place += bisect_right(A[i], mid)
            if place < req:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
```
